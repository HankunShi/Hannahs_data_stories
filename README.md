Social Distancing is an important factor in the fight against the COVID19 Pandemic. Nevertheless, to date, there has been very little research on how to quantify and measure social distancing.

It is indeed a difficult task. People move around and it is virtually impossible to keep track on their interactions and physical distance from others.
Accurately measuring social distancing would allow society to predict cases and inform decision makers by providing real-time data. This crucial step would enable to take highly targeted preemptive measures, rather than wide lock-downs.

In this project we explore ways in which society can measure social distancing by using control variables: Park Gatherings, collected by NYC Department of Parks & Recreation, and Transportation data, collected by Apple.
